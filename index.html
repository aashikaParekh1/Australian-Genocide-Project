										<h2>Summary</h2>
										<p>For thousands of years, Australia had been originally home to the Aborigines. When the British came over, many vicious fights happened between them and the Aborigines, which ended in death. However, the main reason was due to the British bringing over diseases, bunnies, and sheep, which worsened their environment. On top of this, the British became overbearing when it came to farming methods. They would try to enforce their ways onto the Aborigines, which also ended in cruel clashes. Some Aborigines, that trespassed over the colonists’ land would get shot on sight. Killings and massacres sadly ended 140 years later, leaving around 60,000 native aborigines. To this day only 30,000 people claim to have aborigines ancestors.</p>

										<p>Lemkin’s idea of genocide is accurately portrayed the inhumane actions conducted by the European colonists. Lemkin points out that genocide has been done when destruction by mass killings is planned against a nation and an intent to annihilate a group is created. The colonists planned over 270 massacres during the years, creating a focus on killing as many aborigines as possible.</p>

							<h2>More about the Aboriginals <i class="fa fa-chevron-right" aria-hidden="true"></i></h2>
							<!--h3>Orange County Convention Center</h3-->
							<h4>"An original inhabitant of Australia"</h4>
							<p>Australia is Earth’s driest and flattest continent, which makes it hard to farm and live. However, Aboriginal tribes have lived in peace with this type of environment for more than 30,000 years. At first, Aborigines, were mainly nomads, traveling in pods, hunting for animals. Women were the main hunters of the group as they brought in 80% of the food used to eat. Religious-wise, Aborigines feel connected to the land and rivers on a spiritual level. Celebrating through major rituals and harmonious gatherings. This is why the Aborigines felt internal destruction when being forced off the land, due to their strong link to the environment.</p>
